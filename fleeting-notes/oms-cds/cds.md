# Credit Default Swap

[← Back to OMS CDS Notes](./README.md)

CDS pays (1-R) * Notional on default where R is the recovery rate as a % of notional. The purchases makes regular payment in exchange for the insurance. The payments made by the purchaser to the seller are known as the **spread**

A CDS specifies

* **Reference Entity** the underlying company the insurance is on
* **Seniority** of capital covered by the CDS
* **Maturity** 5 years is standard
* **Notional** aa
* **Contract Spread**
* **How spread is paid** "full running", "fixed coupon + upfont"

A seller of a CDS gets the CDS spead. If combinated with a risk free bond we get a corporate bond 

$$ Corporate Bond = Risk Free Bond - CDS $$


The buyer of a CDS is short credit risk

## What does it mean to be long credit risk
One quirk in terminology is that is we are long stocks then if the stock prices increases we make money. If we are long bonds then we profit when bond prices increase. With credit we have a different scenario. **If we are long credit risk we will lose money if credit risk increases**. With credit risk the term long means 

* Exposed to credit risk 
* Bearing on credit risk
* Taking on credit risk

So if credit risk increases (spreads widen, defaults rise) you lose money because you are the one bearing that risk. Long credit risk describes your risk exposure not your directional bet. You are the entity that will suffer if credit conditions deteriorate. If we say an options seller is **long tail risk** is means they are exposed to tail risk not they will profit from it increasing. 

If an investor thinks credit risk will increase they would buy CDS protection and we say they are short credit risk. If credit increases then the spread will also increase and they will make money
