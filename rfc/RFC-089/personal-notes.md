# Personal Notes 

PMS (Portfolio Management Service) is positions aware and hence can determine open and close flags per allocation. 

When an order is submitted from Trade Pad it sends it to Dione which for compliance. Dione in turn forwards it to Helga which is the Rosa Compliance engine. Helga also return its view on whether the allocation is an open or close trade.
